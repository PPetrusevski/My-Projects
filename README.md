## Introduction:
**Brainster Labs** is a project assigned to us - the students, which tends to create a web application in which projects made by students at the Brainster academies can be displayed and presented.

## Technologies used in this version:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and jQuery.

## Description:
The website is based on a design determined by Brainster Academy. The site includes subtle and non-intrusive hover effects and animations. It is also responsive for mobile as well as tablet devices. The employment form contains required fields and displays validation messages on invalid inputs.

The index page consists of:
* Navbar with links that lead to the websites of the designated Brainster academies, as well as a button that leads to another HTML file which contains a form for employment of Brainster students.
* Banner with background image
* 3 buttons which have a role of filtering the cards below, depending on which academy is selected.
* 20 cards aimed at showcasing the projects made by students at three of the Brainster academies.
* Footer

The student employment page consists of:
* The same Navbar as shown above
* Form that should collect data from an interested party in students employment, which also offers an option to choose the type of student required. 
* Footer
