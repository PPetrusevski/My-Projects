## Introduction:
**Periodic Table of Elements** is a project, which as it's name says, represents an interactive Periodic Table of Elements Web application available in two languages, macedonian and english.

## Technologies used in this version:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, GIT.

## Description:
The web app is based on a design provided by Brainster Academy. It's available in two languages, macedonian and english. It's interactive, the user can click on each of the elements,  which opens a modal-like page that contains detailed info about that element, static image and an image slider. 

Each of the 18 periodic groups has a separate label which is also clickable and opens a modal with an iframe that leads to the appropriate wikipedia page. 
There is also an option to enable a click-like sound when hovering over the elements, that is disabled by default. 

There is a search feature integrated which allows the user to search for elements by name or symbol.
