## Introduction:
**Coin Tracker** is a project, which has a goal of helping you track your monthly incomes and expenses.

## Technologies used in this version:
HTML, CSS, ReactJs, MaterialUI.

## Description:
The web app is based on a design provided by Brainster Academy. It was mainly build as mobile web app, but it's also responsive on bigger screens.
 
The first screen is a mock Sign In form, with e-mail and password validation, which also has a link to a Sign Up page for first-time users. The Sign In form leads directly to the Overview page, and the successful sign up leads to a three step Welcome Wizard, where the user can enter it's budget, choose categories, and set amounts for each category. 

The user can then use those categories through out the app, edit or disable them, and add entries for each of the active categories. 

There is also a Statistics section where there are visual charts respresenting the entries.
